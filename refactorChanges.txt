- Refactor all variable name to have meaning full names. 

- Better not to add extension to input file. We might ask user to provide an input file name (with the extension) 
- Read file content should be a function which reads the file based on the extension
- This function will provide error when the input is not .yml

later if we have more input types this function will be the one who get changes

# getting Names of Parameters
- We can do this in a single loop since we can access key and value, key will be the condition name. So you will be able to populate 'paramNames' from the key.

- You can have 2 main arrays, 1 for first condition / other one for the rest of the conditions
-- with this method you don't need to keep seperate length counts for loops, you can just loop for the 1st and 2nd array counts

-- generate the final data set (including exclusions) using a function

-- output generation should also be a function
